### more ideas (long term)

Make a website where you can upload your sounds of the synths or instruments
that you like.

Send it to a cloud instance where it runs a bunch of python code.

Send back audio files of different generated synths  
(with like random midi patterns and loudness).

Choose which one you like, and download the synth as an actual plugin
that you can load up into Ableton (maybe MAX) and actually feed midi and play it!
